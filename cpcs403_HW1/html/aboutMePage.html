    <h1>About Me</h1>

   
    <p>
      Hi! I’m <strong>Abdullah Alhowaish</strong>, a senior Computer Science student at King Abdulaziz University
      in Jeddah (graduating in 2026). I’m a curious builder who likes to take small ideas and turn them into clear,
      reliable software. I’ve developed simple Flutter apps—like a random image generator and a quiz app—and I’m
      steadily growing my skills in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Dart</strong>.
      I’m comfortable with tools such as Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, and basic SQL and Linux,
      and I enjoy courses that make me think structurally, like Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, Operating Systems,
      and Computer Networks. Outside the classroom, I stay active in student groups: I contribute in the Data Science
      Club’s PR &amp; Activities efforts and learn with peers in the Cybersecurity Club. I’m currently seeking an
      internship where I can contribute to real projects while continuing to learn and ship useful features. I value
      clear communication, clean code, and being dependable: if I say I’ll deliver something, I do my best to deliver
      it well and on time. When I’m not coding, I tinker with my PC setup, read about new tools, and help friends solve
      practical tech problems. My long-term goal is to become the kind of engineer who not only writes solid code, but
      also documents, tests, and supports what I build so others can depend on it. If my work and interests resonate
      with you, feel free to reach out through the contact links on my site—I’m always open to learning opportunities,
      collaborations, and feedback.
